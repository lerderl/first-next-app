This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## MY MUSINGS

This section and going further down will include every milestone and issue I face while starting my journey with NEXT.js.

### Installation Issues

Had to run the command below to enable me to create this application by installing the latest npm version.

```bash
npm install -g npm@latest
```

### Issues with Images

If you have any issues with the imports, please try one of the following two solutions:

1. Update your tsconfig.json's path field to look like this:

    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"],
      "public/*": ["./public/*"]
    }

Make sure to fully restart your server before testing again.

2.Add a / character in front of public anytime you need to import a static image:

import homeImg from './public/home.jpg';
